# Farm Management System

## Overview

The **Farm Management System** is a web-based application designed to manage a farm's operations. This system allows users to manage farmers, workers, farms, crops, equipment, and crop inventory. It includes an admin panel for full CRUD operations, a farmer dashboard for managing farms and responding to workers, and a worker dashboard for sending messages to farmers. The system is built using **Streamlit** for the front end, with **MySQL** as the database for back-end operations.

## Features

- **Admin Panel**: Full control over farmers, workers, farms, equipment, and crops.
- **Farmer Dashboard**:
  - View, add, and edit farmer details.
  - Place equipment orders.
  - Respond to worker messages.
- **Worker Dashboard**: 
  - View farmer details.
  - Send messages to farmers with payment information.
- **User Authentication**: Admin, farmer, and worker roles with specific privileges.
- **Custom Background**: The interface includes a customizable background image for a personalized user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Backend**: MySQL Database
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas` for data handling.
  - `MySQL Connector` for database interaction.
  - `PIL` for image handling.
  - `Base64` for encoding images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server
- Required Python packages (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  streamlit
  mysql-connector-python
  pandas
  pillow
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/farm-management-system.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your MySQL database:
   - Create a MySQL database named `farm_management`.
   - Run the provided SQL script to create necessary tables (`Users`, `Farmer`, `Worker`, `Farm`, `Crop`, `Equipment`, `Messages`, etc.).

4. Update the database connection in the `get_connection` function in your script with your MySQL credentials.

   ```python
   def get_connection():
       return mysql.connector.connect(
           host="localhost",
           user="your_mysql_username",
           password="your_mysql_password",
           database="farm_management"
       )
   ```

## How to Run the Application

1. Run the application using Streamlit:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

## How to Use the Application

### Admin Login

- The admin can manage all entities in the system including users, farmers, workers, farms, crops, and equipment. 
- Upon logging in, the admin can navigate the dashboard and choose the table to manage (Users, Farmers, Workers, Farms, Equipment, Crops, Crop Inventory).

### Farmer Login

- A farmer can view their details, manage farm operations, place equipment orders, and respond to worker messages.
- Farmers can also view the crops and crop inventory associated with their farms.

### Worker Login

- Workers can view farmer details and send messages to farmers including payment offers.
- The worker can send job-related queries to farmers and await a response.

## Key Functionalities

### User Authentication
The system allows login for different roles (Admin, Farmer, Worker). Each role has specific privileges:
- **Admin**: Full access to the system for managing all tables.
- **Farmer**: Limited access to manage their own data and respond to workers.
- **Worker**: Ability to view farmers and send messages.

### Admin Dashboard
The admin can:
- View, add, and delete users.
- Manage details of farmers, farms, workers, crops, and crop inventory.
  
### Farmer Dashboard
Farmers can:
- View and edit their own details.
- Place orders for equipment.
- Respond to workersâ€™ messages.

### Worker Dashboard
Workers can:
- View farmers.
- Send messages to farmers along with details of payment offers.

### Message System
Farmers and workers can communicate via the message system. Workers can send messages to farmers with offers, and farmers can reply to these messages.

## Custom Background

You can set a custom background for the application by placing the image file path in the `image_path` variable inside the `get_base64_of_image` function.

```python
image_path = "C:\\path_to_your_image\\background_image.jpg"
```

This image will be displayed as the background of the web application.
